To the moon 去月球

游戏的故事要素挺多，但不复杂，很感人。

你忘了但我不会忘，我会一直暗示你但我不说；我忘了但我还是记得有不得不做的事。

```
River: “I wouldn’t mind. Just for once… to have the same name everyone else has. It’s like those lights in the sky… They all look the same from here, but that doesn’t make them any less pretty.”
Johnny: “So… what do you think they really are? The stars, I mean.”
River: “I… I’ve never told anyone, but… I’ve always thought they were lighthouses. Billions of lighthouses… … stuck at the far end of the sky.”
Johnny: “Wow, it must be so lively up there.”
River: “But it isn’t. They can see all the other lighthouses out there, and they want to talk to them. But they can’t, because they’re all too far apart to hear what the others are saying. All they can do… is shine their lights from afar. … So that’s what they do. They shine their lights at the other lighthouses, and at me.”
Johnny: “Why you?”
River: “Because one day… … I’m going to befriend one of them.”
